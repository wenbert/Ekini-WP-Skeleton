A barebones / boilerplate / skeletal theme for Wordpress. 

Uses http://getskeleton.com (Version 1.1)

Note that you will need to customize this theme. This theme is "minimized".

My workflow:

1) Design a layout (Photoshop, etc.). You can use the template found in /templates 
   or download it from http://getskeleton.com/#download
2) Convert the layout into HTML
3) Convert the HTML file into a Wordpress theme

This theme will come in handy in Step 3. For example, you define the grid layout, 
columns, text colors, fonts, spacing, etc. yourself.

* Since most of the Wordpress theme I created have a horizontal navigation
  bar, I have included the CSS for #access in style.css
* Also added the image CSS (align right, left, etc) by default.
* This also contains the default CSS for Skeleton.
